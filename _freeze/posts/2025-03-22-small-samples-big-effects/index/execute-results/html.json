I'll use effect size here. Effect sizes are the \"so what\" of scientific discovery. Just because we see a difference doesn't mean that difference is meaningful – or, the treatment won't dramatically change the odds of the outcome occurring.\n\nOne of my favorite examples is the finding that [eating one hot dog will result in 36 minutes off your lifespan](https://sph.umich.edu/news/2021posts/small-changes-in-diet-could-help-you-live-healthier-more-sustainably.html) [@stylianou2021small]. No hard feelings to the authors, there's no doubt that hot dogs are not great for your health.\n\nBut, for the sake of discussing the \"so what\", let's break it down. 1 hot dog = 36 mins / 60 mins per hour / 24 hours per day / 365 days per year = 6.849315e-05 years of life. So, how many hot dogs do you need to eat to lose 1 year of life? 14,600.\n\nLet's say you live to be 75 years old. Then you need to eat 195 hot dogs per year *for* *75 years.* You'd need to be averaging one hot dog every other day *for 75 years*.\n\n🌭 So, I won't be changing my hot dog eating habits. I am not eating nearly enough hot dogs to make a meaningful dent in my lifespan. Plus, I love hot dogs.\n\nAnyway! Back to the point.\n\n## Just because it's published doesn't mean it's real\n\nRandomized control trials (RCTs) are generally considered the gold standard, or at least a good approximation of the gold standard, for capturing and measuring real treatment effects.\n\nWe need accurate treatment effect estimates to:\n\n1.  Actually improve health outcomes\n2.  Guide clinical practice\n3.  Accurately test new treatments\n\nWe want to do the best science all the time! But RCTs have many resources and constraints to balance, like: financial and human resources, how many patients to enroll, safety, ethics (stopping trials early due to benefit or harm), regulatory risk, etc.\n\nAs I see it there are two major threats to accurate effect size estimation in RCTs:\n\n1.  **Publication Bias** – Journals largely publish significant results. People tend to want to read about things \"that work\" over things \"that don't\". The consequence of this is that journals end up only publishing a subset of the studies actually conducted on a given treatment. And not even a random subset, a systematic subset of largely significant findings. By the generally acceptable [Type I error rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) (5%), approximately 5% of all studies may falsely identify an effect when none exists.\n    -   📑 A nice read on what publication bias means, and how to measure it [@fujian2013publication]\n    -   Publication bias parallels many cognitive biases we have to combat when exploring data and interpreting results. We tend to think that if we see p \\< 0.05, it means we have attained something *real*.\n    -   This is not specific to RCTs – it's a threat to all published studies.\n2.  **Interim Analyses** (or small sample sizes) - As mentioned above, sometimes there is good motivation to stop a study early. In very high stakes trials, like cancer trials, stopping a trial early could mean reducing the time that the placebo group *doesn't* receive an effective treatment. As a simplification, studies can stop early when their pre-determined statistical analysis performed at \"interim\" shows statistically significant differences. However, meta-analyses have shown that trials that stop early due to early detection of an effect often overestimates those differences, because smaller, more realistic effects take longer to reach significance.\n    -   📑 I really like this paper by Bassler et al 2010 [@bassler2010stopping], see @fig-bassler from the paper.\n    -   This would apply to any prospective cohort study too\n    -   Study size can also be an arguable surrogate for interim analysis, because in general, they occur *before* a certain number of events are attained.\n\n[![Figure 3 from Bassler et al.

We're going to assume that we have two groups that are different from each other. We'll:\n\n1.  Generate $N$ observations of a random variable ( $y_1$) that is normally distributed with a mean ( $\\mu_1$) and standard deviation ( $\\sigma$)\n2.  Pre-determine our effect size ( $\\Delta$ )\n3.  Generate another set of $N$ observations of another random variable ( $y_2$) that is normally distributed with a mean that is offset by our pre-determined effect size plus a little random noise ( $\\mu_2 = \\mu_1 + \\Delta + \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.25)$ ) with the same standard deviation ( $\\sigma$, to make our lives even simpler)\n    -   The little bit of random noise ($\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.25)$) added is meant to sort of reflect noise in ✨the real world✨.\n4.  Perform a two-sample t-test (with equal variances), and obtain:\n    -   The observed effect size ( $\\hat{\\Delta}$ ) , and it's 95% CI\n    -   The p-value for that test\n\nRepeat 🔁 this process 100 times across a range of sample sizes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\" code-summary=\"Data generating and testing function\"}\nsimulate <- function(mu1, mu2, sd, n_per_group){\n  y1 <- rnorm(n_per_group, mu1, sd)\n  y2 <- rnorm(n_per_group, mu2, sd)\n  \n  test <- t.test(y1, y2, var.equal = TRUE)\n  \n  p <- test$p.value\n  delta <- mean(y1) - mean(y2)\n  ci <- as.numeric(test$conf.int)\n  \n  results <- tibble(delta = delta, \n                    lower = ci[1],\n                    upper = ci[2], \n                    pvalue = p)\n  return(results)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Sweep set up\"}\n# Define sweep and simulation setup\nn_sweep <- seq(2, 100, by = 2)\nn_sims <- 100\n\n# Create a cross grid of simulations\nresult_data <- crossing(n_per_group = n_sweep, \n                        sim = 1:n_sims) %>%\n  mutate(delta = NA_real_, \n         lower = NA_real_,\n         upper = NA_real_,\n         pvalue = NA_real_,\n         n = NA_integer_,\n         true_delta = NA_real_)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Setting the simulation parameters\n\nNow, let's define $mu_1$, $\\sigma$, and $\\Delta$:\n\n-   $\\mu_1 = 5$\n\n-   $\\sigma = 2$\n\n-   $\\Delta = 1 + \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.25)$\n\nWe're going to test this in sample sizes from 2–100 per group, and each run will be simulated 100 times.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Looping over Ns\"}\n# Perform simulations\nset.seed(666) # 😈\n# True parameters for the simulation\ndelta <- 1\nmu1 <- 5\nsd <- 2\n\nfor(i in 1:nrow(result_data)){\n  true_delta <- delta + rnorm(1, 0, 0.25)  # Introduce some variability in true_delta\n  mu2 <- mu1 + true_delta  # Adjust mu2 based on the true delta\n  n_per_group <- result_data$n_per_group[i]  # Number of samples per group\n  \n  sim_results <- simulate(mu1, mu2, sd, n_per_group)\n  \n  result_data[i, colnames(sim_results)] <- sim_results\n  result_data$n[i] <- n_per_group * 2  # Total sample size (n_per_group * 2)\n  result_data$true_delta[i] <- true_delta  # Store true delta\n}\n\nresult_data$bias <- -1*result_data$delta - result_data$true_delta\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Effects in small studies are *wildly variable*\n\nStudies with small sample sizes (small numbers of patients) produce much more variable treatment effect estimates and are therefore much more likely to show large differences when they are in fact small (@fig-sample-sizes ).\n\nNow, on average, across *all studies*, these effects average out to be around the true effect (1). So, if all studies on this effect were published, we could estimate that the treatment effect was around 1 by taking the average effects across all of these studies – no matter the size of the study! So long as we have many of those studies!\n\nSo, to answer the first question ( @sec-questions ) : *\"How much does sample size influence bias in treatment effect?\"*. The answer, strictly based on the [statistical definition of a biased estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator#Definition)(which is the difference in the expected values), the answer is actually *none.*\n\n::: {.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\nNote that this is contingent entirely on a completely unbiased selection of studies.\n:::\n\nBut the variance is incredibly high. And this variance is problematic.

When there are real effects, we need consistently huge studies to approach unbiased estimates. This is a huge cost to study administrators and patients.\n2.  While not presented here, in the case of no real effects, publication bias would encourage acceptance of false positives (those studies that happen to fall into the Type I error).\n\nSo, as we go about reading papers and designing studies, we should think critically about what we are powering, what is being reported, and what it actually means.\n\nSeems to me the only way to genuinely address this is to conduct *many studies* on the *same topic*. Replicate, replicate, replicate. And yet... often papers are rejected because they are not \"novel\" 😵\n",
