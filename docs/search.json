The plasma lipidome is not well characterized in dogs with HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction. We therefore aimed to describe the alterations that occur in the plasma lipid composition of dogs that are fed a HFD and examine the association of these changes with the clinical signs of metabolic dysfunction. Dogs were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 12¬†weeks. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and beta cell compensation (AIRG) were assessed through an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and serum biochemistry was analyzed before the introduction of HFD and again after 12¬†weeks of continued ND or HFD feeding. Plasma lipidomics were conducted prior to the introduction of HFD and again at week 8 in both ND and HFD-fed dogs. 12¬†weeks of HFD feeding resulted in impaired insulin sensitivity and increased beta cell compensation measured by SI¬†(ND mean: 11.5 [mU/l]‚Äì1¬†min‚Äì1, HFD mean: 4.7 [mU/l]‚Äì1¬†min‚Äì1) and AIRG¬†(ND mean: 167.0 [mU/l]min, HFD mean: 260.2 [mU/l]min), respectively, compared to dogs fed ND over the same duration. Chronic HFD feeding increased concentrations of plasma lipid species and deleterious fatty acids compared to dogs fed a ND. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) concentrations were significantly associated with fasting insulin (R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.29), SI¬†(R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.49) and AIRG¬†(R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.37) in all dogs after 12¬†weeks, irrespective of diet. Our results demonstrate that chronic HFD feeding leads to significant changes in plasma lipid composition and fatty acid concentrations associated with metabolic dysfunction. High SFA concentrations may be predictive of deteriorated insulin sensitivity in dogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{peloquin2024,\n  author = {Peloquin, Matt and Tovar, Ashley and L.

    "text": "Read full article here.\n\nSummary\nLater circadian timing during adolescence is linked to worse sleep, more severe depression and greater alcohol involvement, perhaps due to circadian misalignment imposed by early school schedules. School schedules shifted later during the COVID-19 pandemic, ostensibly reducing circadian misalignment and potentially mitigating problems with depression and alcohol. We used the pandemic as a natural experiment to test whether adolescent drinkers with later circadian timing showed improvements in sleep, depression and alcohol involvement. Participants were 42 adolescents reporting alcohol use. We assessed circadian phase via dim light melatonin onset prior to the pandemic, then conducted remote assessments of sleep, depressive symptoms and alcohol use during the pandemic. Mixed-effects models were used to test for pandemic effects, covarying for age, sex, time since baseline evaluation, and current school/work status. Adolescents with later circadian timing reported less sleep than other teens on school nights, both before and during the pandemic. Although school night sleep increased during the pandemic (F‚Äâ=‚Äâ28.36,¬†p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001), those increases were not greater for individuals with later circadian timing. Individuals with later circadian timing reported larger increases in alcohol use than other teens during the pandemic (X2‚Äâ=‚Äâ36.03,¬†p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001). Depressive symptoms increased during the pandemic (X2‚Äâ=‚Äâ46.51,¬†p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001) but did not differ based on circadian timing. Consistent with prior reports, adolescents with later circadian timing obtained less sleep, and later school schedules facilitated increased sleep duration. Nonetheless, individuals with later circadian timing reported the sharpest increases in alcohol use, suggesting that circadian timing contributes to risk for alcohol use beyond the effects of insufficient sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{p._hasler2023,\n  author = {P.

    "text": "Read full article here.\n\nAbstract\nCoordinated emotional responses across psychophysiological and subjective indices is a cornerstone of adaptive emotional functioning. Using clustering to identify cross-diagnostic subgroups with similar emotion response profiles may suggest novel underlying mechanisms and treatments. However, many psychophysiological measures are non-normal even in homogenous samples, and over-reliance on traditional elliptical clustering approaches may inhibit the identification of meaningful subgroups. Finite mixture models that allow for non-elliptical cluster distributions is an emerging methodological field that may overcome this hurdle. Furthermore, succinctly quantifying pairwise cluster separation could enhance the clinical utility of the clustering solutions. However, a comprehensive examination of distance measures in the context of elliptical and non-elliptical model-based clustering is needed to provide practical guidance on the computation, benefits, and disadvantages of existing measures. We summarize several measures that can quantify the multivariate distance between two clusters and suggest practical computational tools. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the measures across three scenarios that allow for clusters to differ in location, scale, skewness, and rotation. We then demonstrate our approaches using psychophysiological and subjective responses to emotional imagery captured through the Transdiagnostic Anxiety Study. Finally, we synthesize findings to provide guidance on how to use distance measures in clustering applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{l._wallace2023,\n  author = {L.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Read full article here.\n\nAbstract\nBackground:¬†Robust evidence links sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances to alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, with a growing literature implicating reward-related mechanisms. However, the extant literature has been limited by cross-sectional designs, self-report or behavioral proxies for circadian timing, and samples without substantive alcohol use. Here, we employed objective measures of sleep and circadian rhythms, and an intensive prospective design, to assess whether circadian alignment predicts the neural response to reward in a sample of late adolescents reporting regular alcohol use.\nMethods:¬†Participants included 31 late adolescents (18‚Äì22 y/o; 19 female participants) reporting weekly alcohol use. Participants completed a 14-day protocol including pre- and post-weekend (Thursday and Sunday) circadian phase assessments¬†via¬†the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), in counterbalanced order. Sleep-wake timing was assessed¬†via¬†actigraphy. Circadian alignment was operationalized as the DLMO-midsleep interval; secondary analyses considered social jet lag based on weekday-weekend differences in midsleep or DLMO. Neural response to reward (anticipation and outcome) was assessed¬†via¬†a monetary reward fMRI task (Friday and Monday scans). Alcohol use was assessed at baseline and¬†via¬†ecological momentary assessment. Mean BOLD signal was extracted from two regions-of-interest (striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) for analyses in regression models, accounting for age, sex, racial identity, and scan order.\nResults:¬†In primary analyses, shorter DLMO-midsleep intervals (i.e., greater misalignment) on Thursday predicted lower striatal and mPFC responses to anticipated reward, but not reward outcome, on Friday. Lower neural (striatum and mPFC) responses to anticipated reward on Friday correlated with more binge-drinking episodes at baseline, but were not associated with alcohol use in the post-scan weekend. In secondary analyses, greater social jet lag (particularly larger weekend delays in midsleep or DLMO) was associated with lower neural responses to reward anticipation on Monday.\nConclusion:¬†Findings provide preliminary evidence of proximal associations between objectively determined circadian alignment and the neural response to anticipated monetary reward, which is linked in turn to patterns of problematic drinking. Replication in a larger sample and experimental designs will be important next steps to determining the extent to which circadian misalignment influences risk for alcohol involvement¬†via¬†alterations in reward function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{a._hasler2022,\n  author = {A.

The final cohort consisted of 131,140 dogs.\nMethods:¬†In this retrospective cohort study, Cox proportional hazard models were used to test for associations between osteoarthritis incidence and age at baseline, sex, maximum body weight, maximum body condition score, neuter status, and age at neutering. The same model was used to test these associations in 12 representative breeds, chosen based on breed weight and sample size.\nResults:¬†Older age, higher adult body weight, gonadectomy, and younger age at gonadectomy were significantly associated with higher risks of osteoarthritis in the total cohort and in all 12 breeds evaluated. Higher body condition scores and sex were also significantly associated with osteoarthritis but with minimal effect sizes in the overall cohort, and these risk factors were not consistently significant in all breeds tested.\nClinical relevance:¬†These results will assist veterinarians in identifying dogs at higher risk for osteoarthritis and applying appropriate diagnostic, preventative, and treatment interventions. An understanding of potentially modifiable risk factors, such as body condition and neutering, will support evidence-based discussions with dog owners about risk management in individual patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{l._graves2023,\n  author = {L.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn longitudinal studies and clinical trials, we often want to be able to compare how changes from baseline differ across groups ‚Äì specifically what the percent change from baseline is and how that differs across groups.\nIt‚Äôs tempting to re-calculate the outcome itself as percent change (\\(Y_{\\%\\Delta} = 100*\\frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}\\)) and then perform the statistical test of your choice on that new outcome. However, this isn‚Äôt a robust choice for a few reasons (which maybe warrants its own blog post? (In the meantime, see this collection of statistical myths, and other references¬†5). But, to summarize, converting your longitudinal data to a percent change score leaves you open to bias through:\n\nRegression to the mean\nMathematical coupling\nSkewness & non-normality\nHeteroscedasticity & increased variability\n\nLog-transformations to the rescue!\nIf your data are &gt; 0 you can reliably estimate percent change by simply taking the log(y) of your outcome. If your data do include 0 (but are never &lt; 0) , then you can do log(y+1) ."

However, most prior studies assessed a limited range of sleep characteristics, studied a narrow age span, and included few follow-up assessments. Here, we used six annual assessments from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study, which spans adolescence and young adulthood with an accelerated longitudinal design, to examine whether multiple sleep characteristics in any year predict alcohol and cannabis use the following year.\nMETHODS:\nThe sample included 831 NCANDA participants (423 females; baseline age 12‚Äì21 years). Sleep variables included circadian preference, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, timing of midsleep (weekday/weekend), and sleep duration (weekday/weekend). Using generalized linear mixed models (logistic for cannabis; ordinal for binge severity), we tested whether each repeatedly-measured sleep characteristic (years 0‚Äì4) predicted substance use (alcohol binge severity or cannabis use) the following year (years 1‚Äì5), covarying for age, sex, race, visit, parental education, and previous year‚Äôs substance use.\nRESULTS:\nGreater eveningness, more daytime sleepiness, later weekend sleep timing and shorter sleep duration (weekday/weekend) all predicted more severe alcohol bingeing the following year. Only greater eveningness predicted a greater likelihood of any cannabis use the following year. Post-hoc stratified exploratory analyses indicated that some associations (e.g.¬†greater eveningness, shorter weekend sleep duration) predicted binge severity only in female participants, and that middle-high school, versus post-high school, adolescents were more vulnerable to sleep-related risk for cannabis use.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur findings support the relevance of multiple sleep/circadian characteristics in the risk for future alcohol binge severity and cannabis use. Preliminary findings suggest that these risk factors vary based on developmental stage and sex. Results underscore a need for greater attention to sleep/circadian characteristics as potential risk factors for substance use in youth, and may inform new avenues to prevention and intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{a._hasler2022,\n  author = {A.

    "text": "Read full article here.\n\nAbstract\nDeveloping valid tools that assess key determinants of canine healthspan such as frailty and health-related quality of life (HRQL) is essential to characterizing and understanding aging in dogs. Additionally, because the companion dog is an excellent translational model for humans, such tools can be applied to evaluate gerotherapeutics and investigate mechanisms underlying longevity in both dogs and humans. In this multi-center, cross-sectional study, we investigated the use of a clinical questionnaire (Canine Frailty Index; CFI; Banzato et al., 2019) to assess frailty and an owner assessment tool (VetMetrica HRQL) to evaluate HRQL in 451 adult companion dogs. Results demonstrated validity of the tools by confirming expectations that frailty score increases and HRQL scores deteriorate with age. CFI scores were significantly higher (higher frailty) and HRQL scores significantly lower (worse HRQL) in old dogs (‚â• 7 years of age) compared to young dogs (‚â• 2 and &lt; 6 years of age). Body size (small &lt; 11.3 kg (25 lbs) or large &gt; 22.7 kg (50 lbs)) was not associated with CFI or total HRQL score. However, older, larger dogs showed faster age-related decline in HRQL scores specific to owner-reported activity and comfort. Findings suggest that the clinician-assessed CFI and owner-reported VetMetrica HRQL are useful tools to evaluate two determinants of healthspan in dogs: the accumulation of frailty and the progressive decline in quality of life. Establishing tools that operationalize the assessment of canine healthspan is critical for the advancement of geroscience and the development of gerotherapeutics that benefit both human and veterinary medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{l._chen2023,\n  author = {L.

Assessments included body composition (weight, body condition score, and adipose mass determined by deuterium enrichment), clinical chemistries, plasma fatty acid quantification, oral glucose tolerance test, and histology of subcutaneous and visceral adipose biopsy samples.\nRESULTS\nThe high-fat diet led to increased body weight, body condition score, fat mass and adipocyte size, hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance, and elevations in serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and several species of free fatty acids. Leptin levels increased in dogs fed a high-fat diet but not in control dogs. There were no significant changes in routine clinical chemistry values in either group.\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nFeeding a high-fat diet for 17 weeks led to potentially deleterious changes in metabolism similar to those seen in natural aging in dogs, including hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. A high-fat diet model may provide insights into the similar metabolic dysfunction that occurs during natural aging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{mckenzie2024,\n  author = {McKenzie, Brennen and Peloquin, Matt and Tovar, Ashley and\n    L.

We identified which features of the 24-h RAR pattern were independently and jointly associated with greater perceived physical fatigability (Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, PFS, 0‚Äì50) in older adults (n¬†= 181, 71.3 ¬± 6.7 years). RARs were characterized using anti-logistic extended cosine models and 4-h intervals of PA means and standard deviations across days. A K-means clustering algorithm approach identified four profiles of RAR features: ‚ÄúLess Active/Robust‚Äù, ‚ÄúEarlier Risers‚Äù, ‚ÄúMore Active/Robust‚Äù and ‚ÄúLater RAR‚Äù. Quantile regression tested associations of each RAR feature/profile on median PFS adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index and depression symptomatology. Later rise times (up mesor; Œ≤ = 1.38,¬†p¬†= 0.01) and timing of midpoint of activity (acrophase; Œ≤ = 1.29,¬†p¬†= 0.01) were associated with higher PFS scores. Lower PA between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. was associated with higher PFS scores (Œ≤ = ‚àí4.50,¬†p¬†= 0.03). ‚ÄúLess Active/Robust‚Äù (Œ≤ = 6.14,¬†p¬†= 0.01) and ‚ÄúLater RAR‚Äù (Œ≤ = 3.53,¬†p¬†= 0.01) patterns were associated with higher PFS scores compared to ‚ÄúEarlier Risers‚Äù.

This work can guide development of interventions aimed at modifying RARs to reduce fatigability in older adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{l._graves2021,\n  author = {L.

While aging-associated changes in metabolic status have been investigated rigorously in humans, less is known about metabolic aging in dogs. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine changes in metabolic health with age, and any associations with frailty and quality of life, in a diverse population of companion dogs. This cross-sectional study enrolled 451 mature, adult companion dogs. Serum adiponectin, ALP, ALT, AST, cholesterol, insulin, IGF-1 and glucose levels were quantified. Additionally, plasma FFA, SFA, PA, OA and LA were quantified in a 61 dog subpopulation. All analytes were significantly associated with age, with the exception of AST. Elevated ALP, ALT, cholesterol, insulin, FFA, PA and OA were correlated with increased frailty scores, while higher levels of glucose and adiponectin were correlated with reduced frailty scores. The strength of these associations increased with age. Higher ALP, ALT and insulin were associated with lower HRQL scores after adjusting for covariates. Our findings establish novel associations between deleterious aging-associated metabolic changes and validated measures of clinical well-being in companion dogs. Future research should investigate the causality of these associations to inform therapeutic strategies targeting age-associated changes to frailty and quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{mckenzie2025,\n  author = {McKenzie, Brennen and Peloquin, Matthew and L.
